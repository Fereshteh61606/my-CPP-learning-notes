#  Atomic Variables

#### What are Atomic Variables?
Atomic variables in C++ provide a way to perform operations on variables that are inherently safe from race conditions when multiple threads access them. This is crucial in multithreading environments where shared data must be accessed or modified by multiple threads.

#### Characteristics of Atomic Variables:
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Operations on atomic types are guaranteed to be atomic, meaning they complete as a single operation without interruption. This helps prevent inconsistencies when multiple threads read or write to the same variable.
- **Lock-Free**: Many atomic operations are lock-free, meaning they do not require mutexes, resulting in better performance under contention (when multiple threads compete for access).

#### Common Atomic Types in C++:
- `std::atomic<T>` is the template class for atomic types. You can use it with built-in types like `int`, `bool`, `pointer`, etc.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>

std::atomic<int> counter(0);

void incrementCounter() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        counter++; // Safe increment; no need for mutex
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(incrementCounter);
    std::thread t2(incrementCounter);
    
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    
    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << counter.load() << std::endl; // Safely obtain the value
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example:
- `counter` is an atomic integer initialized to 0.
- Two threads increment the counter simultaneously without any race conditions, as the atomic operations guarantee safety.

### Summary
- **`std::map`** is a container that manages key-value pairs where keys are unique and stored in sorted order. It is useful for quickly searching, inserting, and deleting key-value pairs.
- **Atomic variables** ensure safe concurrent access by providing atomic operations, making them suitable for multithreaded programming. They alleviate the need for using mutexes for simple operations like increments.

### Why Use `std::atomic`?

Using `std::atomic` for the progress values allows multiple threads to update the progress without requiring locks for every read and write operation. This can improve performance and reduce the risk of deadlocks or contention when multiple threads are trying to access the same data.

### Example Context

In your code, it's likely that `functionProgress` is something like this:

```cpp
std::map<std::string, std::atomic<int>> functionProgress;
```

Where keys are function names (as strings) and the values are atomic integers representing the percentage of completion for each function. By using `load()`, your `checkStatus()` function can safely print the progress of all functions without risking inconsistencies or race conditions.

### Conclusion

In summary, `entry.second.load()` retrieves the current progress percentage of a function in a thread-safe manner, ensuring that the value is accurately read even if other threads are updating it concurrently. This is a common pattern in multi-threading to ensure data integrity and safety. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
